# Data-Cleaning-and-Analytics-in-Knime
## University Project, Second Year Semester 1
### Introduction
This project involves working with a dataset containing 100,000 entries across three different financial credit score classes, each with 24 attributes. The primary objectives are to clean and prepare the data and to build two predictive models using the KNIME analytics platform. Specifically, I implemented Naïve Bayes and Random Forest models to predict the "Credit_Score" class.

Key Lessons
  - Clean the dataset based on provided instructions.
  - Divide the dataset into training and test sets.
  - Build and evaluate Naïve Bayes and Random Forest models.

The goal of this project is to equip the student with practical experience in data cleaning, data splitting, model training, and output explanation. Through this exercise, students will develop skills essential for building effective predictive models.
